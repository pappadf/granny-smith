# Support

Thank you for using Granny Smith! This document provides guidance on how to get help with the project.

## Getting Help

If you have questions, need help using Granny Smith, or want to discuss features and ideas:

- **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pappadf/granny-smith/discussions)** – Ask questions, share tips, and connect with other users and contributors

Please use Discussions rather than Issues for general questions and support requests. This helps keep the issue tracker focused on bugs and feature requests.

## Reporting Bugs

If you've found a bug, please:

1. Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/pappadf/granny-smith/issues) to see if it's already been reported

   - A clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Your browser version and operating system
   - Any relevant error messages or screenshots

## Feature Requests

Have an idea for a new feature? We'd love to hear it!

- Start a [Discussion in the Ideas category](https://github.com/pappadf/granny-smith/discussions/categories/ideas) to gauge interest and get feedback
- Once the idea is refined, it may be converted to an issue for implementation tracking
