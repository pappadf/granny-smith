# Integration test: Boot to desktop
# This script boots the emulator with System 6.0.8 and verifies it reaches the desktop

# Boot with VBL-based timing (~120M instructions for full boot)
run 120000000

# Compare screen against reference desktop image
# Path is relative to the current working directory (tests/integration/boot/)
screenshot --match desktop.png

# Exit with success (screenshot --match sets exit code)
