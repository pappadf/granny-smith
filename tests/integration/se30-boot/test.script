# Integration test: SE/30 Boot
# Loads Universal ROM, boots SE/30 for 50M instructions, verifies no crash.
# The ROM will enable the PMMU for 24-bit mode and probe hardware IDs.

# Run 50M instructions to exercise ROM init (checksum, RAM test, PMMU, VIA probing)
run 50000000

# If we reach here, the ROM boot code ran without fatal bus errors or infinite loops
quit
