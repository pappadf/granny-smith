# Integration test: SCSI Hard Disk Boot
# This script boots the emulator from a SCSI hard disk and verifies it reaches the desktop

# Boot with VBL-based timing (~120M instructions for full boot)
run 120000000

# Compare screen against reference desktop image
# Path is relative to the current working directory (tests/integration/scsi/)
screenshot --match desktop.png

# Exit with success (screenshot --match sets exit code)
quit
